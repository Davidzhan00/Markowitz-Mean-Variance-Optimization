This repository contains the code and methodology for an algorithmic trading project based on Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization for short-term portfolio management.

The project leverages an orthogonal-GARCH methodology to produce daily estimates of stock and portfolio variance. Mean returns are estimated with three different approaches: historical averages, moving averages, and exponentially-weighted moving averages.
